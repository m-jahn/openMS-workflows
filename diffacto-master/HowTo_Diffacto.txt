# BASH COMMANDS TO RUN DEMIX-Q
#
# LIBRARIES
# 
# requires some external python libraries:
# -numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn, networkx, scikit-learn
#
#
# RUNNING DIFFACTO
#
# Diffacto applies factor analysis to MS quantified peptides and rules out peptides by low covariation score
# Quantification is additionally based on covariation weights. Vital custom version returns also peptide and not just protein output
#
# PARAMETERS
# -i		peptide quantification file, csv table with first column peptides sequences
# -db		Protein database in FASTA format
# -samples	File of the sample list. One run and its sample group per line, separated by tab.
# -out		Path to output file (writing in TSV format)
# -out_type     Either 'peptide' or 'proteins' (the default)
# *for more optional arguments see manual

# POST PROCESSING
#
# Diffacto returns optionally a list of peptide quantifications and weights
# peptides can be aggregated to proteins with an custom R script that uses the weight as filter or optionally
# to calculate weighted mean or sum of peptides. The script can be found under
